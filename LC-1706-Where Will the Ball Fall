//Question -

You have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, and you have n balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as 1.
A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as -1.
We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern 
between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after 
dropping the ball from the ith column at the top, or -1 if the ball gets stuck in the box.

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: This example is shown in the photo.
Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.
Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.



//Approach-1

//Recursive (DFS)

Time Complexity - O(M*N)
Space Complexity - O(M) - Recursive stack space

vector<int> findBall(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        vector<int> result(grid[0].size(), 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < grid[0].size(); i++) {
            result[i] = findBallDropColumn(0, i, grid);
        }
        return result;
    }

    int findBallDropColumn(int row, int col, vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // base case; ball reached the last row
        if (row == grid.size()) return col;
        int nextColumn = col + grid[row][col];
        if (nextColumn < 0 || nextColumn > grid[0].size() - 1 ||
            grid[row][col] != grid[row][nextColumn]) {
            return -1;
        }
        return findBallDropColumn(row + 1, nextColumn, grid);
    }
